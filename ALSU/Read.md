# ALSU

>The ALSU (Arithmetic, Logic, Shift Unit) is a core digital hardware component widely used in processors, microcontrollers, and custom datapath designs. Its role is to perform arithmetic, logic, and shift operations on binary data, enabling CPUs and DSPs to execute computations and data manipulations efficiently.
