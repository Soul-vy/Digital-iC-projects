## 🔍 Project Overview

The 8-bit ALU supports six core operations:
- Unsigned Addition  
- Unsigned Subtraction  
- 2’s Complement Negation of Operand A  
- Bitwise AND  
- Bitwise OR  
- Bitwise XOR  

Peripheral components include:  
- **Debouncer:** Cleanses noisy push button inputs  
- **ALU Core:** Arithmetic and logic operation unit  
- **Binary to BCD Converter:** Prepares data for 7-segment display  
- **Clock Divider:** Reduces clock frequency for multiplexing  
- **Anode Select:** Activates individual 7-segment digits sequentially  
- **7-Segment Multiplexer:** Selects BCD digits or letter display  
- **7-Segment Decoder:** Translates BCD to segment control signals  
- **Top Module:** Integrates all submodules and manages interfaces

## 📊 Block Diagram

Inputs → Debouncing → ALU Core → Binary-to-BCD Conversion → Display Multiplexing → Output  
- Inputs: Push Buttons (Load A, Load B, Operation), Switches (Operand/Opcode)  
- Outputs: 8-bit LEDs and 7-segment display (ones, tens, hundreds, letter)

## ⚙️ Module Details

### Debouncing Block
- Removes noise from mechanical push buttons  
- Implements clock division and flip-flop synchronization for clean signals  

### ALU Core
- Takes two 8-bit operands and a 3-bit opcode  
- Performs specified arithmetic/logic operations  
- Produces 9-bit output including carry  
- Outputs 4-bit character code for display (e.g., “A” or “B”)  

### Binary to BCD Conversion
- Converts 8-bit binary ALU output to BCD format suitable for display  

### Clock Divider
- Scales down high-frequency clock (e.g., 50MHz) for multiplexed display and debouncing  

### Anode Select and 7-Segment Multiplexer
- Cycles through displaying one digit at a time  
- Selects between number digits and letters  

### 7-Segment Decoder
- Converts BCD inputs to segment control signals for display  

### Top Module
- Integrates all blocks and manages input/output coordination
